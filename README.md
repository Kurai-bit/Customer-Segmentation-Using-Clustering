# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering
## Perform customer segmentation on a mock e-commerce dataset using unsupervised learning techniques to identify customer behavior patterns.

## Tasks
Data Requirements:
- Provided transactional dataset (customer_id, purchase_amount, frequency, recency)
- Preprocess data (handle missing, scale numeric features)
- Apply K-Means and DBSCAN clustering
- Determine optimal number of clusters using Elbow method and Silhouette score
- Visualize clusters using PCA or t-SNE
- Interpret each cluster (e.g., “frequent spender,” “inactive customer”)

Deliverables:
- Python code with visualizations
- PDF report explaining each cluster and business recommendation
- Plots showing cluster separation and decision

## Submit:
Notebook + Slides (5–7) or Report (2–3 pages)

## Estimated time: 2 weeks
